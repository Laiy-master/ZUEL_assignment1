# How to start with the code?
You should get the h5py, pyntcloud, skimage package by 

```
pip install h5py
pip install pyntcloud
pip install scikit-image
```

## Environment settings
We test the code with Python 3.7 (and higher) on the Windows platform and the code may run on linux as well.

## Demo
The **demo.py** includes a demo for the feature extraction of colored point cloud and we provide with a colored point cloud sample **hhi_5.ply**.

## Database
The code is tested on the SJTU-PCQA database which can be downloaded at [https://smt.sjtu.edu.cn/].

The code is also tested on the WPC database which can be downloaded at [https://github.com/qdushl/Waterloo-Point-Cloud-Database].

## Experiment Update

We update the experiment files for SJTU-PCQA and WPC databases, which includes the MOSs and extracted features from point clouds.
We do not use the GGD, AGGD, Gamma parameters of color features in this experiment version for simplification.

## Other PCQA works
We implement and collect several common PCQA metrics, which can be accessed through [https://github.com/zzc-1998/Full-reference-point-cloud-evaluation].
